        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
        I love computers! I loved them since I was a kid. I started using computers when I was just 8y/o. I remember playing games
        and exploring new and interesting things on computers. 11 years later I'm an engineering studen with computer science major. I
        dream of being a Machine Learning engineer an make algorithms to solve real world problems. My area of specialization is Data Science.

        </p>

        <p>
          I'm born and brought up India. I'm skilled in many areas of technical field, but even better is my integrity towards anything
          I promise to complete. I am a team player and have led many of them to victory. I've great communication skills, in both writing and
          speaking which have helped me to connect with people over the years and achieve common goals for the greater good!
        </p>

        <p>
          My motivation for being a computer science major student is the  joy of creating wonders out of nothingness. I love sitting
          and coding ideas to life for people to see and leave them awestruck! I've a solid background of programming since I've been
          doing it since I was 12. I look forward to learn more about Computer Science subject going ahead and work with awesome people in
          the field.
